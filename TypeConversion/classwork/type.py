# Imagine you have hot water but need it cold for your 
# drink you either cool it down or add ice to convert it.

# Just like that, sometimes in Python, you need to change 
# a value’s "type" to something else so it works in your code.

# Python Type Conversion Analogy
# Real Life	Python Code
# Hot water → Cold =>	float → int or str → int
# Cold water → Hot =>	int → float
# Ice cube → Water =>	str → float
# Water → Steam    =>	int → str

# Example Explanation for Kids:
# Let’s say someone types “5” 
# but that’s a string, not a real number.
# You want to add that “5” to another number, like 10.
# But Python says: “Wait! You’re trying to add a word to a number! 
# That’s not allowed.”


# So, you convert it:
# age = "5"
# new_age = int(age) + 10
# print(new_age)  # Output: 15
# Now Python is happy! 🎉 You turned the word "5" into a 
# real number using int()!

# 🔟 Type Conversion Challenge Questions for Kids
# 🧊🔥 (Hot & Cold Water Style)

# Hot to Cold Water!
# age = "12"
# ➤ What do you need to do so you can add age to a number like 3?

# Real Action!
# Convert "100" (a string) into a number and add 50 to it.
# ➤ What will the output be?



# Cold to Hot Water!
# score = 10
# ➤ Convert it into a string so you can join it with:
# print("Your score is " + ?)


# Ice to Water!
# Convert the string "3.14" into a number with decimal.

# ➤ Which function do you use?
# Which One Works?
# Which of these will crash your code?

 
# a = int("4")
# b = float("5.0")
# c = int("hello")
# What Will Print?

# number = "7"
# print(int(number) + 3)
# ➤ What will this output be?

# Fix the error!
# age = "10"
# print("Next year, you will be " + age + 1)


# ➤ This will crash! How would you fix it?
# What is the Type After Conversion?
# val = str(9.8)
# ➤ What is the type of val now?


# Turn Water into Steam!
# ➤ Write a line of code that turns number 50 into a string and prints:
# "Your score is 50"

# Can You Convert This?
# data = "True"
# ➤ Can you convert this string into a real boolean value in Python?
# (Hint: Try bool(data) — what does it return?)
