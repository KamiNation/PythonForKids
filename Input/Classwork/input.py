# Receiving input means the computer is asking YOU something 
# like a question.
# And YOU get to type the answer! It‚Äôs like the computer is having a 
# conversation with you.

# Example Explanation:
# Imagine your computer is your friend. When it says:
# ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù   you type: Zara
# That‚Äôs input   you‚Äôre giving your answer to the computer, 
# and it listens!

# üß© The Questions:

# Save it in a variable called yourName. (Datatype: string)

# Ask: "How old are you?"
