# Receiving input means the computer is asking YOU something 
# like a question.
# And YOU get to type the answer! It’s like the computer is having a 
# conversation with you.

# Example Explanation:
# Imagine your computer is your friend. When it says:
# “What’s your name?”   you type: Peter
# That’s input   you’re giving your answer to the computer, 
# and it listens!

# 🧩 The Questions:
# Ask the user: "What is your name?"
# Save it in a variable called yourName. (Datatype: string)
myName = "Peter is my name"
print("myName =>", myName)

yourName = input("What is your name? ")
print("yourName =>", f'{yourName}', "Nice to meet you!")



# Ask: "How old are you?"
# Save the answer in a variable called yourAge. 
# (Datatype: string   can be converted to number later)
yourAge = input("How old are you? ")
print("Your age =>", yourAge)




# Ask: "What is your favorite color?"
# Save the answer in favouriteColor.

# Ask: "What food do you love the most?"
# Save it in bestFood.

# Ask: "Do you have a pet? Yes or No?"
# Save the answer in hasPet. 
# (string   can lead to a True/False check later)

# Ask: "What school do you go to?"
# Store the answer in schoolName.

# Ask: "How many books do you have?"
# Save in bookCount. (Still a string for now)

# Ask: "What time do you wake up?"
# Store the answer in wakeUpTime. (e.g. "6:30am")

# Ask: "What is your favorite animal?"
# Save in favouriteAnimal.

# What is the datatype of anything you get using input()

# name = "My name is Tosisn peter"

# print(name)

# inputName = input("What is your name?: ")

# print(f"{inputName}, nice meeting you")
