# What Is a String in Python?
# A string is like a sentence or word wrapped in quotes.


# Think of it as a gift box for words, letters, numbers, 
# emojis anything you want to say!
# As long as itâ€™s inside quotation marks (" " or ' '), 
# Python treats it as a string.


# we use the "", and anything within the "is a string"
# single_string = ''
# double_string = ""

# How to Know Itâ€™s a String?
# If it looks like words or symbols and is wrapped in 
# quotes â†’ itâ€™s a string.

# If it doesnâ€™t have quotes â†’ Python thinks itâ€™s a number, 
# a command, or a variable.



# Single quotes can hold strings
single_quote = 'I am a single quote'
print("single quote =>", single_quote)

# This can break if there's an apostrophe inside
# The apostrophe in "Field's" ends the string too early
# That's why double quotes are better here
single_quote_error = "Flourish Field's academy"
print("single quote with apostrophe =>", single_quote_error)

# Double quotes can also hold strings (good when using apostrophes inside)
double_quote = "I am a double quote"
print("double quote =>", double_quote)

# Triple single quotes can hold multi-line strings (like a poem or a letter!)
single_multi_string = ''' 
A B C D E F
G H I J K L
M N O P Q R
'''
print("SINGLE multi-line string =>", single_multi_string)

# Triple double quotes do the same thing!
double_multi_string = """ 
J K L M N
O P Q R S
T U V W X
"""
print("DOUBLE multi-line string =>", double_multi_string)

# Numbers in quotes are still strings (they look like numbers, but are actually text!)
number_string = "40"
print("number_string =>", number_string)
print("number_string type =>", type(number_string))

# Numbers without quotes are real numbers (integers)
number_number = 40
print("number_number =>", number_number)
print("number_number type =>", type(number_number))

# You can combine strings using + or f-strings
tomisin = "Tomisin"
peter = "Peter"
# Using + to join strings
message = tomisin + " and " + peter + " are learning strings in Python!"
print("message (with +) =>", message)

# Using f-string (easier and cleaner!)
message_f = f"{tomisin} and {peter} are learning strings in Python!"
print("message (with f-string) =>", message_f)

# You can even mix in multi-line strings
fun_message = f"{double_multi_string}\n---\n{single_multi_string}"
print("fun message with multi-lines =>", fun_message)


#  1. What is an f-string?
# Think of it as a magic sentence that lets you plug in your variables easily.
name = "Tomisin"
age = 11
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# ğŸ”¹ 2. Compare with traditional concatenation:
# With + signs
print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")

# With f-string
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
# Explain: The f-string is shorter and easier to understand.

# ğŸ“˜ Fun Real-World Analogy:
# Imagine your f-string is a sentence with blank spaces. 
# You just fill in the blanks with variables like a Mad Libs game!
