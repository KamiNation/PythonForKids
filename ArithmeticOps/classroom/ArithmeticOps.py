# # Arithmetic Operations
# 💡 Idea for Kids

# Think of arithmetic operations as the math tools your computer uses 
# to calculate things, just like how you use your calculator in school!

# Python Arithmetic Operators
# # Symbol	Meaning	     Example	    Result
#       +	Add	            3 + 2	    5
#       -	Subtract	    5 - 3	    2
#       *	Multiply	    4 * 2	    8
#       /	Divide	        10 / 2	    5.0
#       //	Floor Division 	10 // 3	    3
#       %	Modulus 	    10 % 3	    1
#       **	Exponent    	2 ** 3	    8



# These are like buttons on your calculator, each does something special.
# + is for adding sweets 🍬, 
# - is for sharing and taking away, 
# * is for repeated adding, 
# / is for dividing between friends!

# Simple Example
a = 10
b = 3

# print("Addition:", a + b)
# print("Subtraction:", a - b)
# print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b + a)
# print("Floor Division:", a // b)
# print("Remainder:", a % b)
# print("Power:", a ** b)

# 🎯 Challenge Questions (5 examples)

# Create two variables called x and y and try 
# all arithmetic operations on them.

# What is the remainder when 15 is divided by 4?
x = 15
y = 4
print("Remainder:", x % y)

# Multiply 8 by 5 and store the result in a variable.
result = 8 * 5
print("Multiplication Result:", result)

# Use ** to find 3 raised to the power of 4.
power_result = 3 ** 4 ## 3*3*3*3
print("Power Result:", power_result)

# Divide 25 by 6 using / and // — what’s the difference?
div_result = 25 / 6
floor_div_result = 25 // 6
print("Division Result:", div_result)
print("Floor Division Result:", floor_div_result)
