# What Are Variables? 
# A variable is like a school bag variable.
# You can put something inside it like a book, a pencil, 
# or your lunch.
# In programming, a variable holds a value like your name, 
# your age, or your favorite color.


#Variable Name (lhs)     equals-to    value (rhs)
variableName             =            "Python for Peter and Tomisin"
