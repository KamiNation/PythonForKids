# What Are Data Types in Python?
# Think of data types like different 
# kinds of boxes you put things in.

# Python needs to know what kind of thing you're giving it 
# is it a number? A word? Something that's just True or False?

# The Data Types and Their Kid Explanations:
# Data Type	What It Holds	Kid-Friendly Example
# string	Words or text	"Hello", "45" (even though it's a number!)
# int	Whole numbers	5, 22, 0
# float	Numbers with decimals	3.14, 10.0, 0.5
# bool	True or False	True, False
# list	A group of things	["book", "pen", "eraser"], [1, 2, 3], []
# dict	A pair of label and value	{"hero": "Spiderman"}

# example of dict - personal data
personalData = ["tomisin", 11, "5'4"]
personalDataDict = {"name": "tomisin",
                    "age": 11, 
                    "height": "5'4"}

# ✨ Tip: Every time you create something in Python, 
# it's like putting a value inside one of these boxes!

# Imagine you have different kinds of boxes at home:

# One box holds words 

# Another holds whole numbers 

# Another holds decimal numbers (like prices) 

# Another just says Yes or No 

# Another holds a group of things like toys in a basket 

# And the last one has pairs like labels and names 

# That’s what data types are in Python   
# different boxes for different kinds of values!

# 10 Challenge Questions for Data Types
# Let’s test what you’ve learned! Ready? 😎

# What data type is "Hello world"?
# A. string
# B. int
# C. bool

# What box should you use to store the number of pencils you have — like 10?
# A. string
# B. float
# C. int

# If your mom gave you 4.5 biscuits, what data type is that?
# A. int
# B. float
# C. list

# What data type is used to store just True or False?

# Look at this: ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

# What kind of data type is it?

# What would this be? {"name": "Alex", "age": 11}

# A. list

# B. string

# C. dictionary

# Is "45" a number or a string?

# What data type is best for prices like 2.99, 10.50, or 0.75?

# Which of these is a list?
# A. "notebook"
# B. ["notebook", "ruler", "pen"]
# C. {notebook: "blue"}

# Write one example for each data type:

# A string:

# An int:

# A float:

# A boolean:

# A list:

# A dictionary:




peter = "peter"
print(type (peter))

intString = "11"
print(type (intString))

boolString = "true"
print(boolString)
