# What Are Data Types in Python?
# Think of data types like different 
# kinds of boxes you put things in.

# Python needs to know what kind of thing you're giving it 
# is it a number? A word? Something that's just True or False?

# The Data Types and Their Kid Explanations:
# Data Type	What It Holds	Kid-Friendly Example
# string	Words or text	"Hello", "45" (even though it's a number!)
# int	Whole numbers	5, 22, 0
# float	Numbers with decimals	3.14, 10.0, 0.5
# bool	True or False	True, False
# list	A group of things	["book", "pen", "eraser"], [1, 2, 3]
# dict	A pair of label and value	{"hero": "Spiderman"}

# âœ¨ Tip: Every time you create something in Python, 
# it's like putting a value inside one of these boxes!

# Imagine you have different kinds of boxes at home:

# One box holds words 

# Another holds whole numbers 

# Another holds decimal numbers (like prices) 

# Another just says Yes or No 

# Another holds a group of things like toys in a basket 

# And the last one has pairs like labels and names 

# Thatâ€™s what data types are in Python   
# different boxes for different kinds of values!
